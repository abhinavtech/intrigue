# The 1859 space weather event revisited: limits of extreme activity

This paper by Edward W. Cliver and William F. Dietrich analyzes the solar flare of September 1, 1859, and its associated geomagnetic storm, which are considered benchmarks for extreme solar-terrestrial events.

## Key Findings

*   **Solar Flare Classification:** The soft X-ray (SXR) peak intensity of the 1859 flare is estimated to be of class X45 (±5). For comparison, the powerful flare of November 4, 2003, was estimated to be an X35 (±5) event.
*   **Geomagnetic Storm Intensity:** The magnetic storm following the 1859 flare is estimated to have a minimum Dst index of -900 (+50, -150) nT. This is comparable to the great storm of May 1921, which had an estimated Dst of -825 to -900 nT.
*   **Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) Event:** While there is no direct evidence from ice cores of an SEP event associated with the 1859 flare, a correlation-based estimate suggests a >30 MeV SEP fluence of approximately 1.1 × 10¹⁰ pr cm⁻². This is about twice the fluence of the largest SEP events of the modern era (July 1959, November 1960, and August 1972).
*   **Comparison with the 1921 Storm:** The paper draws parallels between the 1859 and May 1921 events, noting similarities in auroral extent, technological impacts (including fires caused by telegraph system disruptions), and the size of the associated sunspot groups.
*   **Conclusion:** The authors suggest that the 1859 storm, while at the upper end of the scale, is not a unique event but rather an extreme example within the natural distribution of magnetic storms.
