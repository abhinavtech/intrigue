# Statistical analysis of the Carrington storm

A study was conducted on the intensity of the Carrington magnetic storm of September 1859, using data from the Colaba observatory in India. A lognormal statistical model of storm intensity was developed to characterize the maximum-negative value of the storm-time disturbance index (maximum –Dst) versus geomagnetic disturbance recorded at low-latitude observatories during magnetic storms. With this model and a recently published presentation of the Colaba data, the most likely maximum –Dst of the Carrington storm and its credibility interval are estimated.

The study found that if the most extreme Colaba disturbance value is included in the analysis, the median maximum –Dst is 964 nT, with a 68% credibility interval of nT. If the most extreme Colaba disturbance value is excluded from the analysis, then the median maximum –Dst is 866 nT, with a 68% credibility interval of nT. The widths of these intervals indicate that estimates of the occurrence frequency of Carrington-class storms are very uncertain, as are related estimates of risk for modern technological systems.

The results also indicate that only about one in a million storms with a maximum –Dst like the Carrington storm would result in a local disturbance greater than that reported from Colaba. This suggests that either the Colaba data were affected by magnetospheric-ionospheric current systems in addition to the ring current, or there might be something wrong with the Colaba data.
