# Summary of Key Findings on the Carrington Event

This document summarizes the initial findings from a review of research papers and articles on the Carrington Event of 1859.

## Key Points

*   **First Recorded Solar Flare:** The event on September 1-2, 1859, was the first time a solar flare was independently observed and recorded by astronomers Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson.

*   **Rapid CME Arrival:** The associated Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) traveled to Earth in a remarkably short 17.6 hours, a journey that typically takes several days.

*   **Intense Geomagnetic Storm:** The resulting geomagnetic storm is considered the most intense in recorded history.

*   **Global Impacts:**
    *   Telegraph systems worldwide failed, with reports of sparks, equipment damage, and operators receiving electric shocks.
    *   Auroras were visible at unusually low latitudes, as far south as the Caribbean.

*   **Modern Relevance:**
    *   The Carrington Event serves as a benchmark for understanding the potential impacts of a similar, modern-day event.
    *   A storm of this magnitude today would likely cause widespread and long-lasting damage to our technological infrastructure, particularly the electrical grid and satellite communications.

## Sources

*   **Original Report:** The initial observations were published in the *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*.
*   **Modern Analysis:**
    *   A 2013 study in *Space Weather* re-evaluated the size and effects of the 1859 flare.
    *   A 2024 paper in the *Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate* used modern data to model the storm's intensity.
