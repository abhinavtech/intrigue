# Economic Impact of a Carrington-Level Event

This document summarizes the potential economic impact of a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the Carrington Event.

## Key Findings

*   **Estimated Cost:** A Carrington-level event today is estimated to cause between **$0.6 and $2.6 trillion** in damages in the United States alone.

*   **Infrastructure at Risk:** The primary economic impact would stem from damage to critical infrastructure, including:
    *   **The Electrical Grid:** Widespread and long-lasting blackouts would disrupt all sectors of the economy.
    *   **Satellite Communications:** Disruption to GPS, communication, and data satellites would have a cascading effect on numerous industries.
    *   **The Internet:** The potential for an "internet apocalypse" would cripple the digital economy.

*   **Agricultural Impact:** Beyond direct damage to the grid, significant disruptions to agriculture are anticipated due to the impact on industrial production and supply chains.

## Sources

*   **space.com:** Estimates the cost of a Carrington-level event to be between $0.6 and $2.6 trillion in the U.S. alone.
*   **Wikipedia:** Cites a 2013 study with a similar cost estimate of $600 billion to $2.6 trillion and highlights the potential for disruptions to agriculture.

This analysis underscores the immense economic vulnerability of modern society to a Carrington-level event. Further research is needed to refine these estimates and develop effective mitigation strategies.
