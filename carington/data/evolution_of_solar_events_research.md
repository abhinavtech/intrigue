# The Evolution of Extreme Solar Events Research

This article discusses the history and development of research into extreme solar events. It begins by referencing the Carrington Event of 1859, a massive solar flare that caused widespread technological disruption and auroras visible across the globe. The article notes that if a similar event occurred today, it could take years to recover from the damage to the electrical grid.

The article explores how scientists study past solar events using methods like analyzing cosmogenic radioisotopes in tree rings and ice cores, which has allowed them to study solar activity as far back as 7176 BC. It also discusses the classification of extreme solar events, questioning whether they are unpredictable "Black Swans" or "Dragon Kings" that lie outside normal patterns but are still predictable.

The article concludes by highlighting the advancements in solar research, including the development of powerful telescopes like the NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, which continue to help scientists understand the Sun and its impact on Earth.
