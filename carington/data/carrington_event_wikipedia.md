# The Carrington Event (Wikipedia)

The Carrington Event, which occurred on September 1-2, 1859, was the most powerful geomagnetic storm ever recorded. It was triggered by a significant solar flare and coronal mass ejection (CME) that was independently observed by astronomers Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson. This CME is believed to have traveled to Earth in a remarkably short 17.6 hours.

The effects of the storm were global. Auroras were seen as far south as the Caribbean and Mexico, and were so bright in the Rocky Mountains that they woke miners who thought it was morning. Telegraph systems across Europe and North America failed, with some pylons throwing sparks and operators receiving electric shocks. In some cases, operators were able to send messages using the auroral current alone.

If a storm of this magnitude were to happen today, it could lead to extensive electrical disruptions, blackouts, and damage to the power grid. A 2013 study estimated that a similar event could cost the US alone between $600 billion and $2.6 trillion. Other research has highlighted the potential for significant disruptions to agriculture due to the impact on industrial production.

Scientists have found evidence of other large solar storms in tree rings and ice cores, including a significant event in 774â€“775 CE that may have been ten times stronger than the Carrington Event.
