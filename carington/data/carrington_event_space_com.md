# The Carrington Event: The Solar Superstorm of 1859

The Carrington Event was the most intense solar storm in recorded history, occurring in September 1859. It was caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun, which was observed by British astronomer Richard Carrington. The CME traveled to Earth in just 17.6 hours, much faster than the usual several days.

The event caused widespread disruption to technology of the time, particularly the telegraph system. Telegraph machines threw sparks, gave operators electric shocks, and even set papers on fire. Auroras, normally only seen in polar regions, were visible as far south as Cuba and Hawaii.

If a storm of the same magnitude as the Carrington Event were to happen today, the consequences would be far more severe. It is estimated that such an event could cause between $0.6 and $2.6 trillion in damages in the U.S. alone and could lead to an "internet apocalypse" by taking large numbers of people and businesses offline. For this reason, the U.K. government lists adverse space weather as one of the most serious natural hazards in its National Risk Register.

While a Carrington-level event is estimated to occur only once every 500 years, less intense storms are more common, happening roughly every 50 years. Scientists are actively working to improve our ability to predict and prepare for these events. NASA's Heliophysics Systems Observatory (HSO) and ESA's Vigil mission are dedicated to studying the sun and providing advance warning of potentially hazardous space weather.
